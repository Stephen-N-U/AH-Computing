Stream+

Stream+ is a desktop movie browsing application developed in Python using CustomTkinter for the graphical interface and Microsoft Access for database management via pyodbc. The system simulates a unified platform for browsing films across streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video. It provides user authentication with separate customer and staff roles. Customers can browse, search, and sort movies by rating or release year and view detailed metadata including description, age rating, streaming service, and rating score. Staff users have additional permissions to add new movies directly to the database. The project demonstrates GUI development, database integration, sorting algorithms, search functionality, and role-based access control within a structured software design.
